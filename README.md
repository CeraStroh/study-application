# study-application
Senior Project for Central College

This project will serve as a tool to help users study concepts, terms, and definitions, as well as retain what they have learned. It is basically my attempt at creating a web application similar to Quizlet.

Creating the app: `npx create-next-app@latest` with TypeScript, ESLint, Tailwind CSS, App Router, and no /src/ directory or customizing default import alias
